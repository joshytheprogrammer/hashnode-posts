## How to integrate sass (scss) into Nuxtjs

Today, we are going to learn how we can work with sass in our Nuxtjs application. Its actually very easy so we'll go straight to the point.
First off  **what is sass?**

Sass is a CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such as nested rules and mixins into regular CSS. The syntax used in Sass is called SCSS.

## Installations

In order to get Sass to work with Nuxtjs, we will need to install the following packages.
*I'm assuming you've already installed Nuxtjs*

1. Style Resources.
2. Sass
3. Sass loader version 10 ( the latest version causes a conflict. )

**Note:-** *We will be using NPM for this tutorial.*

   `npm i @nuxtjs/style-resources sass sass-loader@10`

Once all the packages have successfully been installed, we can move on to the next step:

## Configuration

Before we can start using sass we need to setup a few more things, let's configure the `style-resources` package in our `nuxt config`
**Note:-** *I'm assuming you use Nuxtjs with JavaScript not TypeScript.*

```js

buildModules: [
    '@nuxtjs/style-resources'
],

styleResources: {
  scss: [
    '@/assets/scss/app.scss',
    '@/assets/scss/mixins.scss'
  ],
  hoistUseStatements:  true,
},

```

As you can see, we are telling Nuxt where the base of our sass files will be. I placed mine in the `scss` section of the  `assets` folder I created. The `app.scss` file is typically where I place universal configurations such as colors and viewport definitions. Take a look at the `app.scss` file of one of my nuxt apps:

```scss
// Color Pallete

$light:  #F5F5F5;
$dark:  #0A0A0A;
$success:  #85CB33;
$warning:  #D78521;
$danger:  #CC2936;

// Viewport Sizes

$small:  728px;
$mediumDesktop:  900px;

html,
body  {
  background: $light;
  overflow-x: hidden;
}

```

The `mixins.scss` file is how I add mix-ins.
**Note:-** *You don't have to add the mix-in file. Do so only if you want to add mixins*

Once you've done all this, you can then begin to use

```jsx
<style lang="scss" scoped>
.blog  {
  width:  90%;
  margin:  0 auto;
  padding:  1rem;
}
</style>
```

## Some difficulties I encountered

1. **Errors when importing fonts:-** I remember at some point while using scss with nuxt, I realized I couldn't use the `@import` statement in scss. I never really found the solution to this problem, only a workaround.
**Solution**
 Basically, you handle font import in CSS and then link it in your nuxt config, that solved the problem for me.
 **Note:-** *This problem doesn't just arise in fonts, it can actually arise from any universal declaration. No matter the case, the solution is pretty much the same.*

That's all. Thanks for reading all the way to the end.
